      <p>Insidious is an American horror franchise created by Leigh Whannell and James Wan that has been produced by Blumhouse in association with Sony’s Stage 6 Films since 2010.[1] The films in the franchise include Insidious (2010), Chapter 2 (2013), Chapter 3 (2015), The Last Key (2018), and The Red Door (2023). The films have grossed over $731 million worldwide on a combined budget of $42.5 million.</p>

<p>The first two films were directed by Wan, the third by Whannell (who also served as the screenwriter for all five films), Adam Robitel directed the fourth installment, and Patrick Wilson directed the fifth installment (the films marked the respective directorial debuts for Whannell and Wilson). Jeremy Slater is set to direct the first spin-off and sixth installment. FilmDistrict released the first and second films, while Focus Features, Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Releasing handled the third, fourth, and fifth, respectively.</p>

<p>The first two films center on a couple who, after their son mysteriously enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an astral plane, are continuously haunted by demons from a forbidden realm known as the Further until they take from the family what they want most: life. The couple hire a team of paranormal investigators to help get their son back.</p>

<p>The third film, a prequel, focuses on the same psychic who helped the family; this time she comes to the aid of a young girl who calls out to the dead. The fourth film follows her when her own family becomes haunted. The fifth film follows a grown-up Dalton and his relationship with his father, with the two having to uncover their repressed past. While Josh is haunted by his father's spirit, Dalton gets terrorized by the titular demon of his past.</p>

<p>Lin Shaye, Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson are the only actors to have appeared in all five films.</p>
